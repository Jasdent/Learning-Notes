# Learning-Notes
My aims: 
- langauges: go, java, scala, python. Java is my first OO language to learn so it is detailed. Will focus on the language specialties in the future. 
- algorithms
## Java
- basics from collection framework to JDBC, multithreading, and other.
- web dev: not my particular interest but just want to experience how a web app is structured and get some feeling of what learning a new framework is like. 
- reflection
I am going to write a reflective learning journal of java. It is going to include some understanding on the OO paradigm and web application. Although I have a picture of it in mind, I am not going to dive too deep into this area (e.g. js,nginx,etc) as web can be really complicated as dedicated middlewares are emerging.
