# Learning-Notes
My aims: 
- langauges: go, java, scala, python. Java is my first OO language to learn so it is detailed. Will focus on the language specialties in the future. 
- algorithms

This repo is just a presentation to universities that I applied for master degree, showing my ability to learn new things, as I do not have a computer science related background. 

## Java
- basics from collection framework to JDBC, multithreading, and other.
- web dev: not my particular interest but just want to experience how a web app is structured and get some feeling of what learning a new framework is like.

I am going to write a reflective learning journal of java. It is going to include some understanding on the OO paradigm and web application. Although I have a picture of it in mind, I am not going to dive too deep into this area (e.g. js,nginx,etc) as web can be really complicated as dedicated middlewares are emerging. Current trends on web dev is concurrency and parallelism which might be too hard to experiment with PC.
